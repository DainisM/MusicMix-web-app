# **MusicMix â€“ web app**

This was a school (SKP - skolepraktik) project.

My idea was to make a small web app that can be used to listen to music like Spotify. My web app needs to store and sort all songs in playlists for easy user experience just like Spotify does. One of the purposes was to learn and try ReactJS.

I have chosen to work with ReactJS because I had some experience with JavaScript before and ReactJS is very popular JavaScript library that many people use. I choose Node.js with Express.js to make my REST API.
