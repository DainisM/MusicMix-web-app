# **MusicMix â€“ web app**

This was a school (SKP - skolepraktik) project.

My idea was to make a small web app that can be used to listen to music like Spotify. My web app needs to store and sort all songs in playlists for easy user experience just like Spotify does. User needed to create and then login with an account to be able to browse and listen to music. User could browse music sortet in playlists, search for songs or artists and create their own playlist to save their liked songs into them. One of the purposes was to learn and try ReactJS.

I have chosen to work with ReactJS because I had some experience with JavaScript before and ReactJS is very popular JavaScript library that many people use. I choose Node.js with Express.js to make my REST API.
