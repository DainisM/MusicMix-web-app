        </h3>
        <p>
          At MusicMix, we want to give you the best possible experience to
          ensure that you enjoy our service today, tomorrow, and in the future.
          To do this we need to understand your listening habits so we can
          deliver an exceptional and personalized service specifically for you.
          That said, your privacy and the security of your personal data is, and
          will always be, enormously important to us. So, we want to
          transparently explain how and why we gather, store, share and use your
          personal data - as well as outline the controls and choices you have
          around when and how you choose to share your personal data.
        </p>
        <p>
          That is our objective, and this Privacy Policy (“Policy”) will explain
          exactly what we mean in further detail below.
